# farmit
simple Q

```
batch command generator by c.p.brown, 2018
for encapsulated native projects
hbatch only (I'm using Indie)
linux only
...
assumes farm is in /farm TWO levels up from hip dir:
     /path/to/project/shot/task/hip.hip
     /path/to/project/farm/
     /path/to/project/farm/pending/
     /path/to/project/farm/running/
     /path/to/project/farm/done/
     /path/to/project/farm/themo.sh
 ...
 wedge is a messy bypass hack, hence the code bloat
 only mantra, geo and cop wedging will work atm
 wedge is farmed per frame, per wedge, unless its a sim
 adding int params 'wubs' and 'wube' to wedge will allow range override
 eg: render 5 to 8 of a 10-wedge setup

Doesn't do pause, resume, daisychaining, priorities or any other fancy things... 
just executes a directory full of commands. While you sleep.
